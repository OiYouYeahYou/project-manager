# Project Manager

High altitude project (read repository) management

## Why

Git GUI's are great, but they often don't allow for a higher level of perspective on what you're working on.
When you need to clean up or get back to one of you previous projects this tool is meant to give you a high level of perspective for you project.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. For small changes drive by PRs are great, otherwise please make an issue to discuss first.
